# ica-contributions-guide

Ingressive campus ambassadors are encouraged to collaborate on open source projects together where they can learn, grow their experience
and also build on their portfolio.

Anyone can provide an idea, and since the projects are open source, any one that is a part of the project can be recognized as a 
contributor.

Ambassadors are encouraged to collaborate regardless of school or country and Ingressive will be there to provide as much support as necessary.

So check the repos here if there are any projects you'll like to work on, or submit an idea (here)[https://goo.gl/forms/5qLUU4bHPGFaB5Fm1] to begin
